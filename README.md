# 📱 Rotation Tile

> A simple Android utility that adds a Quick Settings tile to instantly lock your screen orientation to portrait or landscape.

## What It Does

This app provides a single, powerful Quick Settings tile that allows you to force your screen into a specific orientation (portrait or landscape), completely overriding the system's auto-rotate setting. It's designed for situations where you need to lock the screen in one position, such as reading in bed or viewing content that doesn't rotate correctly.

## Key Features

*   ⚙️ **Quick Settings Integration**: Control screen orientation directly from the Quick Settings panel without opening an app.
*   🔄 **Instant Toggling**: A single tap switches the screen lock between **portrait** and **landscape** mode.
*   🔒 **Overrides Auto-Rotate**: Forces a specific orientation even when the system's auto-rotate is on or off.
*   ✨ **Minimalist**: No complex settings or background services. The app is lightweight and focused on a single function.
